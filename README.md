# Java Precourse Exercises

This repository contains a number of exercises which challenge you to put your learning into practice from the Java Precourse.

## Prerequisites

You should have already completed the **Java Precourse** as far as the `Exercises` section which directs you to this repository.

Next, you need to _fork and clone_ this repository. You should already have watched
[this introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VjoJyqQkNQ&ab_channel=Tutor1) to forking and cloning. A reminder:

-   **Fork** the repository to create a copy on your github account
-   **Clone** the copy from your github account down to your local machine

When you have cloned the repository to your local machine, you may find it convenient to open it with Visual Studio Code as a means of easily editing the code files. Alternatively, you can continue to use whichever text editor, or terminal text editor such as `vim`, you've been using up to now.

Either way, you'll have to manually compile and run each file, following the same process we've used so far in the precourse.

## Completing the exercises

In the [1_exercises](./1_exercises/) folder, you will find a number of `.java` files.

Each of these is a standalone mini-program, which you can compile with `javac` and run with `java` at the command line, just like you've been practicing during the precourse.

(Later, we'll explore ways to organise projects like this in a MUCH simpler way!)

In each `.java` file, you'll find instructions for completing the `solve` method. There is also a `main` method which will pass test data to your `solve` function and display success or failure messages when you compile-and-run the code.

### Instructions

1. Implement the missing code as required to fulfil the exercise.
2. Compile with `javac` and run with `java`.
3. If you see only success messages, you are done, and can move to the next file.
4. If you get stuck, move onto another exercise and come back later.

## Debugging and Refactoring

After you complete the `1_exercises` section, return to the Java Precourse website and continue with the `2_fixing_bugs` and `3_refactoring` sections. Each of these has a corresponding folder in this repo which you will work with in a similar manner to the `1_exercises` section.
